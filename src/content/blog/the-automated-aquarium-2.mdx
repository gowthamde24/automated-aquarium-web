## 👨‍💻 Who am I?

Hi geek!

I'm Joserra, a Software Developer with a passion for Internet of Things (IoT) and automation. With a background in Telecommunications Engineering and an MSc in Internet of Things, I've been working in the software industry for several years, developing skills in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), building applications for Industrial Edge Computing, as well as Frontend and Backend development and some bash scripting tasks.

What many don't know is that I've always had a fascination with marine life 🐙 (*I actually wanted to be a Marine Biologist when I was a child!*). This project is where my professional expertise meets my personal **passion**.

## 💡 Why this project?

For years, I've had an empty aquarium gathering dust. The main challenges that kept me from setting it up were:

1. The time-intensive maintenance required.
2. The worry about forgetting crucial care tasks.
3. The difficulty of monitoring water quality consistently.

This project aims to solve these problems through automation, making aquarium keeping accessible even with a busy schedule.

## 🚀 Join me on this journey

I'll be documenting every step of this project - the successes, the failures, and everything I learn along the way. Whether you're interested in aquariums, IoT projects, or just curious about how it all comes together, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

If you have suggestions, questions, or similar projects, I'd love to hear from you! Reach out through my [contact page](../contact). 💬

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more updates! 📝

Best regards,

Joserra
